# FEARS-experiments
This repository contains experiments using the Fast Eigenspace Approximation using Random Signals (FEARS) method. 

In particular, every experiment presented in the paper [FEARS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00938) is available as we follow Reproducible Research principles. 

If you are looking specifically for the methods to apply FEARS, they are available in the [Graph Signal Processing Toolbox](https://github.com/epfl-lts2/gspbox) from version [0.7.0](https://github.com/epfl-lts2/gspbox/releases/tag/0.7.0). The specific functions are [gsp_fast_estimate_lk](https://github.com/epfl-lts2/gspbox/blob/master/utils/gsp_fast_estimate_lk.m) and [gsp_eigenspace_approximation](https://github.com/epfl-lts2/gspbox/blob/master/embedding/gsp_eigenspace_estimation.m).

For this reason, the GSPBox (v0.7.0 and above) is required to run the experiments.
